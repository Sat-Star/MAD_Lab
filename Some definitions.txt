Android Development Cheat Sheet

MainActivity : first screen that appears when a user launches the app.
AppCompatActivity : allows apps to run on older devices
annotation.SuppressLint : tells the Android Lint tool to ignore specific warnings. The Lint tool tells you when something in your code isn't optimal or may crash.
Bundle savedInstanceState : used to store the data of an activity. For example, after an orientation change, the onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) function will call and recreate the activity and load all data from savedInstanceState.
getIntent().getStringExtra : used to receive a value in a String type variable. The method uses the message_key.
Pattern.compile() : compiles a regular expression passed as a string. It's used to match text or expressions against a regular expression more than once.
putExtra() method can store any primitive data type directly with a (key,value) pair. For example, it can be used to set the text content that you want to share.
CompoundButton : a button with two states, checked and unchecked. When the button is pressed or clicked, the state changes automatically.
Spinner : a view that allows users to select one value from a set of values. It's similar to a dropdown list in other programming languages.
